## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Press any key to start the game.
2. A color will flash — memorize it!
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the color buttons in order.
4. Each round adds a new color to the sequence.

### 🧠 **Simon Game Stages**

- **What happens:** Game is idle, screen shows:

- **Trigger:** User presses any key on the keyboard.
- **Action:** Game moves to the next level (Level 1), and the first sequence is shown.

#### 2. **Game Play Stage**
- **What happens:**  
  - Game displays a sequence (by animating one or more color buttons).
  - Player tries to repeat the same sequence by clicking the buttons in order.
- **Feedback:**  
  - If player clicks correctly, the game adds one more color to the sequence and goes to the next level.
  - If wrong, it triggers the game over stage.
